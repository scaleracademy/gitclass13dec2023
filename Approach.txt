1) First we have to create classes: 
a) Main.java
b) Car.java
c) Ticket.java
d) ParkingLotService.java

Now we show all the given option's , and ask user to press any one number from 1 to 5.
 
2) Then a user will enter the Car information (i.e. RegNumber and Color).After pressing "1".
    and we store all the information in Hashmap();
    
3) If user Press 2 we ask user to enter color of a car if Car color
Matches we return all ReqNumber of car's else we print "There is no car with color (with the input color)".

4) If user Press 3 we ask user for Car "RegNumber" is number mathes then we return
then we return the corresponding Ticket Number else print "Car doesn't exist with the given ReqNumber".

5) Now for getting "Ticket Numbers" of all the tickets based on a particular color
we as user to Press 4. If Color mathes then return the Ticket Numbers else print"There is no car with color: (color Name)"

6)Last we ask user to Press 5 for exit.
